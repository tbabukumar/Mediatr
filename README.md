# Mediatr
Sample project is using Mediatr Library developed in .NET 7.0
I used EndPoint Explorer to run the application. Please click "Send Request" inside this file Mediator.http
Mediatr is used with CQRS pattern. So I added one Command and one Query handler to demonstrate
Still need to implement the DI part as it is taking longer, please review and let me know if this is meeting your requirements
